    Over the last two decades, bond rates — which follow interest rates — around the world have decreased. The ten-year US Treasury yield — which was as high as 16 per cent in 1981 — is now just about 1.5 per cent.

    When US long-term interest rates were nearly 16 per cent, pension funds wanting an annual payout of $16m could buy $100m worth of bonds. But now with an interest rate of 1.5 per cent, pension funds only receive an annual payout of $1.5m with a $100m bond.

    This is particularly bad for pension funds, which rely on bonds to fund yearly payouts. To make up the difference for lower interest rates, pension funds have to spend more to get the same annual return. 

    To continue the example, you would need to invest as much as $1.1bn at 1.5 per cent interest rates to make the same amount you would have made with 16 per cent interest rates and $100m, all other things equal.
