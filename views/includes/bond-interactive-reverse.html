    Bond yields have fallen globally since the UK Brexit referendum on June 23. This has made even more acute [a problem for financing pensions](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/8a54a0c6-648b-11e6-a08a-c7ac04ef00aa.html), which has been growing for many years. The problem is greatest for "defined benefit" plans, which have made guarantees to their members about the retirement income they can expect.

    For more than three decades, bond yields — which follow interest rates — around the world have decreased. The ten-year US Treasury yield — which was as high as 16 per cent in 1981 — is now just about 1.5 per cent.

    These yields are treated as a "risk-free rate," which underpins the pricing of all other bonds and many other financial transactions. They also critically affect the price that pension funds must pay to meet their guarantees to their employees.

    For example, when US long-term interest rates were nearly 16 per cent, a pension fund wanting an annual payout of $16m would need only to buy $100m worth of bonds. But now with an interest rate of 1.5 per cent, a pension fund would only receive an annual payout of $1.5m from a $100m bond.

    This is particularly bad for pension funds, which rely on bonds to fund yearly payouts. To make up for lower interest rates, they have to spend more to get the same annual return.

    To continue the simplified example, you would need to invest as much as $1.1bn at 1.5 per cent interest rates to make the same amount you would have made with 16 per cent interest rates and $100m, all other things equal.

    Add to that the fact that people are living longer. That means that pension funds must be prepared to pay out for longer and hence their liabilities grow.

    A further problem for pension funds is that their assets have not grown as fast in recent years, thanks to problems in the stock market. As their liabilities have grown much faster than assets, so their deficits — the gap between the money they have and the money it will take to pay their pensioners — have deepened.

    Let's look at some real numbers. The US public pension deficit is [$3.4tn](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c9966bea-fcd8-11e5-b5f5-070dca6d0a0d.html). That's 6 times the size of Apple. Pension deficits sponsored by S&P 1500 companies are lower at $638bn, but still higher than the GDP of many countries, such as Peru or Belgium. The UK public and private pension deficits are smaller, but follow the same pattern.

    Why does this matter? Although defined-benefit plans are steadily being phased out, they still account for more than half of retirement funds in the developed world. Millions of relatively low-paid public sector workers, typically including teachers, police officers and firefighters — rely on DB pensions for the bulk of their retirement income. So do some of some the largest and longest established corporations on both sides of the Atlantic.
